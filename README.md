# HiggsBoson
Higgs boson is a fundamental particle linked to the Higgs field, which gives mass to other particles. Predicted by the Standard Model and confirmed in 2012 at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, its discovery was a breakthrough in particle physics, helping explain why matter has mass and validating key theories about the universe’s structure.
